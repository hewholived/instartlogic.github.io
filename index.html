While the latest and greatest JS or CSS features can make development fast and fun, they can also lead to poor performing, inaccessible bloat that's impossible for the next developer, even one who is familiar with the frameworks used, to decipher. Development doesn't have to be so complicated. </p><p>

While it's important to keep up to date on new tools and trends, it's even more important to remember where we came from and code inclusively. To move forward you have to look back. Do you really need a framework or can the standards handle your modern challenge while ensuring accessibility.  With a little semantic creativity, vanilla code is the best tool in your tool box.</p>

      <dd><p>By developing with web standards, you can create accessible, performant web sites. Semantic markup helps ensure accessibility while reducing the need for frameworks. Write semantic HTML and leverage CSS Selectors and the cascade, to reduce your CSS and JS by up to 95% and obliterate your queue of accessibility bugs.</p></dd>

<p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the solution for putting our apps on mobile devices. Or is it? Bloated web applications that simply shrink in width are not usable. Squishy design is not the only, or even the main, solution for improved mobile web user experience. Other than responsive design, how can we improve performance so our mobile web applications, responsive or not, are usable and accessible no matter how a user chooses to access it.</p>

      <dd><p>You already know that accessibility is important. In fact, it’s the law. It’s also a good idea. Let’s make the Web accessible—and faster—for everyone.
<p>
We'll skill the “why” and focuses on the “how.” Marking up accessible, performant websites can be as simple as using the right semantic elements in your HTML. Semantic HTML can prevent bugs, improve performance, reduce code bloat, and make your site accessible to screen readers and keyboard users.
<p>
Explore accessibility features native to semantic elements and demonstrates how to add additional accessibility with a sprinkling of ARIA roles and attributes. Estelle also covers making accessible form controls, input masking, attractive selects, and creating a fully accessible carousel that functions perfectly with just a few lines of JavaScript—and no frameworks.</p></dd>
